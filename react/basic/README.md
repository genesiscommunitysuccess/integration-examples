# GenesisLCAP React Basic Integration Example

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic integration of `@genesislcap/foundation-ui` components within a simple React application. It showcases the straightforward usage of two to three core components from GenesisLCAP, providing a starting point for developers to understand how to incorporate these components into their React applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/genesiscommunitysuccess/integration-examples.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd integration-examples/react/basic
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **src/**: Contains the simple source code demonstrating the integration of GenesisLCAP components.
- **build/**: Contains the build output for the application.
- **node_modules/**: Contains npm packages for the dependencies and devDependencies defined in `package.json`.

## Dependencies

The application uses:

- **react, react-dom, and related packages**: Core libraries for building the application.
- **@genesislcap/foundation-ui components**: A few selected enterprise-level UI components to demonstrate basic integration.
- **Development Tools**: Tools such as ESLint, Prettier, Jest are used to maintain code quality and facilitate testing.
